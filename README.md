# Loan Default Prediction

This project implements a binary classification neural network using PyTorch to predict loan defaults. The implementation includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a PyTorch-based neural network model.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for the project
  - `data/`: Data processing utilities
  - `models/`: Neural network implementation
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and visualization tools
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
